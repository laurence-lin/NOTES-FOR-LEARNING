Traditional Time Series Statistic model: AR, MA, ARMA, ARIMA

AR: auto-regressive model, assume current state of variable is influenced by history state

X_t = C + sigma(i=1, p)(tou_i * X_t-i) + epsilon_t

tou_1, tou_2 ... tou_P = parameters of model, C = constant, epsilon_t = white noise, P = order of the past value influence


AR Model view the current state value as the linear combination of past state value.



MA: moving average model, instead of using historical data as base for current state prediction, it use the weight combination of historical error noise to predict the future value.

X_t = mu + epsilon_t + theta_1 * epsilon_t-1 + ... + theta_q * epsilon_t-q

mu: mean of series, theta_1 ~ theta_q: parameter of model, epsilon: white noise error terms


ARMA: auto-regressive moving-average model, combine AR and MA model together
ARMA(p, q) contains p auto-regressive term and q moving-average term, which could be presented as:

X_t = C + epsilon_t + sigma(i=1, p)(tou_i * X_t-i) + sigma(j=0,q)(theta_j * epsilon_t-j)
